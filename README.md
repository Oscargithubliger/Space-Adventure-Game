# Space Adventure Game

Project Title: "Space Adventure Game"

Overview:
In this project, you will create an interactive space adventure game where players can explore a virtual space environment, collect items, solve puzzles, and interact with characters. The game will have multiple levels, and players can progress by completing tasks and challenges.

Technologies Used:

HTML: for creating the structure and layout of the game using HTML tags.
CSS: for styling the game, including fonts, colors, backgrounds, and animations.
JavaScript: for implementing the game logic, including interactivity, event handling, and game mechanics.
Features:

Landing Page: Create a landing page with an animated background of stars and planets, a title, and a "Play" button to start the game.
Game Environment: Design a virtual space environment using HTML and CSS, with a spaceship as the player's character, and planets, stars, and other objects as interactive elements.
Navigation: Implement a navigation system that allows players to move the spaceship around the game environment using keyboard or mouse controls.
Interactions: Create interactive elements such as planets, stars, and characters that players can click on or interact with to trigger events, collect items, or receive hints.
Puzzles and Challenges: Design puzzles and challenges that players need to solve to progress in the game, such as finding hidden objects, unlocking doors, or solving riddles using JavaScript.
Inventory System: Implement an inventory system using JavaScript that allows players to collect and manage items they find during the game, with a visual representation of the items in the UI.
Level Transitions: Create multiple levels with increasing difficulty, and implement level transitions using JavaScript, where players can progress to the next level after completing all the tasks in the current level.
Game Over/Win: Implement game over and win conditions using JavaScript, where players can either lose the game by running out of lives or win by completing all levels and tasks.
Responsive Design: Make the game responsive so that it can be played on different devices, such as desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones, using responsive design techniques in CSS.
This project will require a good understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as creativity in designing a unique space adventure game with interesting gameplay mechanics and visual elements. Have fun coding and creating your own Space Adventure Game!
